## Blockchain Medical Waste Management
This project leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the management of medical waste by enhancing transparency, traceability, and compliance. It aims to tackle key challenges such as improper waste disposal, fraud, and regulatory gaps, which pose risks to public health and the environment. Our project integrates blockchain to track the lifecycle of waste, including classification, and recycling efforts.

# Our Project - MediWasteWatch
## Inspiration
Medical waste management presents a critical challenge due to the hazardous nature of the waste and its potential impact on public health and the environment. The complexity of ensuring proper disposal and compliance with stringent regulations globally adds to the problem. Blockchain technology, known for its decentralised, transparent, and tamper-proof ledger system, has the potential to transform medical waste management, making it more efficient, compliant, and safe.

## The Challenges in Medical Waste Management
Medical waste comprises a variety of hazardous materials, including biological waste, pharmaceuticals, and sharps. Inefficient disposal and poor tracking mechanisms in existing waste management systems can lead to public health crises, environmental contamination, and regulatory non-compliance. Manual processes and lack of transparency create gaps, making it hard to enforce waste tracking, creating opportunities for illegal dumping or mishandling, and heightening safety risks. For instance, improperly disposed of sharps or contaminated pharmaceutical waste can end up in landfills, harming both the environment and communities nearby. In many cases, paper-based record systems are unreliable, and compliance across global regions with varying regulations becomes challenging.
